title: Starting a channel
summary: I'm starting a YouTube channel and this is going to be my secret sauce.

A long long time ago I made video tutorials about the things I learned and I really enjoyed it.
I don't remember why, but doing that on YouTube wasn't a real option back then.
The video format was still pretty fresh it wasn't a financially viable venture at the time.
In life's mysterious ways, it's something I had to abandon for a long time, but the idea of teaching never left me.

Many years have passed and I've always paid attention to what's going on.
At this point, I feel like I'm really late to the game.
But the flip side is that I get to bring everything I've learned over the years with me and I can look to other creators for inspiration because they've paved the path already.

I've been thinking a lot more about YouTube for the past year.
I really want to get into it, but I don't want to add noise or create videos I wouldn't want to watch.

This is the start of my journey.

### Deliberately Different
I think it's important to [stand out](/stand-out).
But how do I apply that idea to YouTube?

It seems like there's already a video for everything, do I really have anything to contribute? 
I think I finally have the answer.

I've seen a lot of advice thrown around like "just do it" and "don't overthink it" and while I appreciate where that's coming from, I'm way past not overthinking it. I've been overthinking it for a year now.

I firmly believe that the key to any success is to be intentional and flexible. 

Even with all the overthinking, I know I'll make a lot of mistakes anyway.
But being intentional isn't about not making mistakes.
Being Intentional is having a plan systematically observing and pivoting as necessary.

So here's my plan.

### I'm going to steal
In his book "Steal Like an Artist" Austin Kleon quotes Salvador Dali:

> Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.

I really enjoy watching [@fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@fireship) videos. I think Jeff (the creator of Fireship) has found the perfect recipe.

The videos are fast-paced and varied and strike a really good balance in terms of adding a bit of flare with humor that's stupid-kind of silly (the best kind) while not being over the top.

I wish there were more videos like that.
I like it so much that, I think I'll steal it.

And that's where Austin has another recommendation for me:

> Don't just steal the style. Steal the thinking behind the style. You don't want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.

Most YouTube developer channels get a bit rambly.
I know for a fact that as soon as I open my mouth to explain anything I'm going to swiftly get to the point 45 minutes later.
Creating fast-paced videos seems like something that doesn't come naturally to me at all. 

LG(_E_)TM.
What could go wrong? 

### The Magic Formula
So with all that going through my head, I think I've finally settled on the formula I'm going to pursue:

**Motto:** Teach while being entertaining. <br>
**Target audience:** People watching YouTube on the pooper.<br>
**Target length:** 5 minutes, +/- 2 minutes.<br>
**Main Objective:** Condense Everything to the shortest possible format.
At the same time, don't just skip over everything.<br>
**Sub-objective:**  Don't take yourself so seriously. ðŸ¦¦

**The key is to be concise by simplifying radically.** 
Explain complex concepts quickly, without sacrificing clarity.

This is the balance that I'm going to chase.

Here I go...
