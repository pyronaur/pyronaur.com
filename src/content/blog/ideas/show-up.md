summary: "I went from dismissing habit tracking to building a habit tracker."

This past year I've been chasing a perfectly green GitHub history.
I know it's stilly.
A year ago I would have argued it's useless.
And yet, there's something to it...

I enjoyed reading Atomic Habits last year around.
One of the ideas James mentions in the book is [tracking habits](https://jamesclear.com/habit-tracker).
At the time, I didn't find the idea too appealing.

Tracking habits seemed like "meta work".
Writing down habits is a habit to get into itself. 
Seems counterproductive.

But the seed of the idea was planted.
A couple of months later I started chasing green on GitHub and a while later I noticed something.
Inspiration comes from doing.

I had my ups and my downs.

Some days that meant a readme change.<br>
Some days it was a small bug fix. <br>
Some days it was just cleaning up code here and there.<br>
And sometimes â€“ I found myself doing more than I expected.

Having a low bar of "_commit something - anything!_" kept me going. All I need to do is show up, even briefly.

Showing up compounds over time.
## Build a habit tracker
What if I could do that for other areas of my life?
James Clear does this by having a habit journal.
I could do that, but I don't get any satisfaction from the tactlessness of pen and paper.
That still seems like a useless obstacle to me.

So I did what I always do - I wrote some more code and made a [habit tracker](/habits). 

This ticks a couple of boxes for me:

**Accountability**
It's publicly visible - so there's the same pressure as with a GitHub profile.

**Cue**
I installed this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) to replace a new tab with my habits page. I can't avoid seeing the habits I've committed to if I sit down by my computer.

**Craving**
I don't like unchecked boxes. If I don't check a box today, it'll be an eyesore for quite some time.

**Response**
Ticking the box is a small sense of achievement, but more importantly:

**Reward**
The habits are achievements on their own, but in addition to that, I'll get a nice reminder anytime I open a new tab.

## Conclusion
Only time will tell how well this is going to work. I'll update the post a couple of months from now with a follow-up.

Overall, I'm excited. I think this can work pretty well, as long as I don't overdo it.

And now we wait...
