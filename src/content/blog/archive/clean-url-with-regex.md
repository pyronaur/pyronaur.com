A regex pattern to fix 1st level domains. Useful for when data is submitted from users:

Turns this:
```
google.com www.google.com google.com/ http://google.com http://www.google.com http://www.google.com/
```
Into This:

```
http://www.google.com http://www.google.com http://www.google.com http://www.google.com http://www.google.com http://www.google.com
```

Expression:

Search:Â 

```
((http://)?(www.)?(\[wd-\]\*?.)(w{2,4})/?)
```

Replace:

```
http://www.$4$5
```

PHP Usage:

```php
// Fix the URL:
$fixedURL = preg_replace('/((http://)?(www.)?(\[wd-\]\*?.)(w{2,4})/?)/i', 'http://www.$4$5', $previousURL);
```
