This is a blog post I wish someone told me a long time ago:

## Being Cautious

You think you're being cautious, but you're just boxing yourself in. You're stuck in an artificial box you made for yourself.

You see the discourse online, and being a reasonable person, you see both sides speaking convincingly about both sides of the coin. You might agree with both of them, or none of them, but you don't engage. What if you're wrong?

And so you stay cautious, stick to the sidelines.

Because what if you get egg on your face when the bubble pops and the hype dies down?

Well, then you'll have...

## An egg on your face

Someone on the internet is going to remember, how you, yes you - dared to look around the corner and discern for yourself what the fuss is about. And god forbid, you'll like what you'll see. That would be real bad, because if the bubble bursts, you'll be left with that egg on your face, and we all know that once you get it on your face, it never comes off.

## Don't fear the hype

Remember the how Google Glass was going to be the future? Yeah, neither do I. Remember someone who got excited? When was the last time you thought about their stupidity? 

Don't fear the hype. Embrace it. **You're allowed an opinion.** You're allowed to make mistakes and grow. Whatever you think about it, it's fine. You do you.

Polarizing views dominate the algorithms, so if think you're lacking the passion or the zealousness of one group or the other, just keep in mind that it's likely the algorithm playing tricks on you again.

At the end of it all, which are you going to regret more - the things you did or didn't do?
